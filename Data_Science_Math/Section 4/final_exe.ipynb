    "# You have to solve 5 tasks in parallel and have 5 engineers at your disposal. Each engineer can only work on one task. How many possibilities are there to distribute the tasks?\n",
    "# The order of the tasks is not important. The tasks are independent of each other. The engineers are also indistinguishable from each other.\n",
