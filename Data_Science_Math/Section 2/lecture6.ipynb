    "# Summary: Quartiles and Interquartile Range (IQR) in Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Quartiles\n",
    "Quartiles divide a data set into four equal parts, providing insights into the distribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculation of Quartiles\n",
    "- **First Quartile (Q1)**: Also known as the lower quartile or 25th percentile, it is the median of the lower half of the data.\n",
    "- **Second Quartile (Q2)**: This is the median of the data set, also the 50th percentile.\n",
    "- **Third Quartile (Q3)**: Known as the upper quartile or 75th percentile, it is the median of the upper half of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Golf Scores\n",
    "- Data Set: Golf scores of 18 players, ranging from 66 to 75.\n",
    "- Median (Q2) = 69 (calculated as the mean of the two middle values in an ordered data set).\n",
    "- Q1 and Q3 are calculated as the median of the respective lower and upper halves of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Five Number Summary\n",
    "A concise description of a data set, which includes:\n",
    "1. **Minimum Value**\n",
    "2. **First Quartile (Q1)**\n",
    "3. **Median (Q2)**\n",
    "4. **Third Quartile (Q3)**\n",
    "5. **Maximum Value**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provides a view of the data's center and spread.\n",
    "- Range of the data set is defined as the maximum value minus the minimum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interquartile Range (IQR)\n",
    "- IQR = Q3 - Q1\n",
    "- Represents the middle 50% of the data.\n",
    "- A smaller IQR indicates data points clustered near the median, while a larger IQR suggests a wider spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying Outliers with IQR\n",
    "- Outliers can be identified using quartiles and IQR.\n",
    "- Lower Bound for Outliers: Q1 - 1.5 * IQR\n",
    "- Upper Bound for Outliers: Q3 + 1.5 * IQR\n",
    "- Values outside these bounds are considered outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Quartiles and IQR provide valuable insights into the distribution of a data set, highlighting the spread and identifying potential outliers.\n"
