      "**Method 2: Using the `nltk` library**\n",

      "```\n",
      "The `nltk` library provides a `word_tokenize` function that splits the text into individual words or tokens.\n",

      "**Method 3: Using regular expressions**\n",

      "1 Introduction\n",
      "Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\n",
      "in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\n",
      "transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\n",
      "efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\n",
      "architectures [38, 24, 15].\n",
      "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\n",
      "sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\n",
      "states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\n",
      "sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\n",
      "sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\n",
      "significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\n",
      "computation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\n",
      "constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n",
      "Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\n",
      "tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\n",
      "the input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\n",
      "are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n",
      "In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\n",
      "relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n",
      "The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\n",
      "translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n",
      "2 Background\n",
      "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n",
      "[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\n",
      "block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\n",
      "the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\n",
      "in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\n",
      "it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\n",
      "reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\n",
      "to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\n",
      "described in section 3.2.\n",
      "Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\n",
      "of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\n",

      "3 Model Architecture\n",
      "Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\n",
      "Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\n",
      "of continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\n",

      "and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\n",
      "position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\n",

      "•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\n",

      "information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\n",

      "of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
      "3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
      "In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\n",

      "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
      "dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
      "ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",

      "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",
