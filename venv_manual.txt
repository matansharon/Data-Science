this is a simple personal manual how to manage and work with couple python environments on your local machine.
1. install homebrew
1.1 if you dont have it already paste this in your terminal
```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

2. install pyenv
3. install the python version you need
4. make the python version global for your machine with this command
```pyenv global <the version you want>
```
5. create the venv you want with this command
```python3 -m venv <name of the venv>
```
6. activate the venv with this command
```source <name of the venv>/bin/activate
6.1 adding the venv to the vscode kernel
```python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=<name of the venv>
```
7. install the packages you need with pip (pip3 for mac)
8. deactivate the venv with this command
```deactivate
```
9. repeat step 5-8 for every venv you need
10. if you want to delete a venv just delete the folder of the venv
11. if you want to delete a python version just delete the folder of the version in the pyenv folder
12. if you want to delete pyenv just delete the pyenv folder
