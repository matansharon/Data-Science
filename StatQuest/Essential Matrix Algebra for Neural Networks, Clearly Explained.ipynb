    "Certainly! The key concepts from the StatQuest video on matrix algebra for neural networks can be illustrated using Python code, particularly focusing on linear transformations, matrix multiplication, and their applications in a simple neural network model. Let's break down the concepts and demonstrate them with Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear transformation can be represented in Python using matrix operations. For example, if we have a point with coordinates \n",
    "(x,y) and we want to apply a linear transformation, we can use a transformation matrix.\n",
    "Matrix Multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, matrix multiplication can be done using NumPy, a library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.\n",
    "Application in Neural Networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic example of how a neural network might use these concepts can be shown. This will include initializing weights, applying transformations to inputs, and adding bias.\n",
    "Let's create some Python code to demonstrate these concepts:"
