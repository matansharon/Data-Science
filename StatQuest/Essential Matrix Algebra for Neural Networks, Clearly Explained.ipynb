    "# Bias and Variance in Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias: \n",
    "Refers to the error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. In your example, the linear (straight line) model cannot capture the complexity of the data (the curve), demonstrating high bias.\n",
    "Variance: Refers to the error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm. The squiggly line model fits the training data too closely (overfits), leading to high variance, as it performs poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "### Overfitting: \n",
    "This occurs when a model is too complex, capturing the noise along with the underlying pattern in the training data. It results in poor performance on new, unseen data, as was the case with the squiggly line model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the Sweet Spot:\n",
    " The goal in machine learning is to find a balance between bias and variance, ensuring the model is complex enough to capture the underlying pattern but simple enough to generalize well to new data. Techniques like regularization, boosting, and bagging help in achieving this balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: Adds a penalty to more complex models to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "Boosting: Combines multiple weak models sequentially to create a strong overall model.\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Involves training multiple models in parallel and averaging their predictions to reduce variance."
