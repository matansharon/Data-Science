    "## Entropy in Data Science - Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Surprise\n",
    "- Entropy is linked to the concept of 'surprise'.\n",
    "- In a system (e.g., chickens of different colors in different areas), the probability of an event is inversely related to the surprise it generates.\n",
    "- Lower probability events yield higher surprise and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equation for Surprise\n",
    "- Surprise is calculated using the logarithm of the inverse of the probability.\n",
    "- Formula: `Surprise = -log2(probability)`\n",
    "- This formula ensures that an event with a certain probability of occurring gives a quantifiable measure of surprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating Surprise for a Series of Events\n",
    "- Total surprise for a sequence of events (like coin tosses) is the sum of individual surprises.\n",
    "- For a biased coin, the surprise differs for heads and tails based on their probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entropy Defined for a Coin\n",
    "- Entropy is the expected value of surprise per event.\n",
    "- In statistics: `Entropy = -sum(probability * log2(probability))`\n",
    "- It represents the average surprise (or uncertainty) we expect from the outcome of an event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entropy in Action\n",
    "- Entropy is used to quantify the similarity or difference in distributions (like the distribution of chicken colors).\n",
    "- Higher entropy indicates a more uniform distribution (equal numbers of different outcomes).\n",
    "- Lower entropy suggests a skewed distribution (one outcome is far more likely than others).\n"
