    "# Git Basic Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture introduces the basics of using Git, focusing on a workflow suitable for a solo developer working within a single branch. We'll cover the essential steps from initializing a repository to pushing changes to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Machine and GitHub**: Understanding the distinction and interaction between your local repository and GitHub.\n",
    "- **Initializing a Repository**: Using `git init` to create a new repository on your local machine.\n",
    "- **Tracking Changes**: Learning how to track additions, deletions, and modifications in your code.\n",
    "- **Staging Area**: Understanding the importance of the staging area in preparing changes for a commit.\n",
    "- **Commits**: Committing changes to the repository with descriptive messages.\n",
    "- **Pushing and Pulling**: Pushing changes from your local repository to GitHub and pulling changes from GitHub to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize a Repository**: Either by creating a repo on GitHub and cloning it locally with `git clone` or initializing locally with `git init`.\n",
    "2. **Track Changes**:\n",
    "   - Use `git status` to check the current status of your repository.\n",
    "   - Remember that initializing a repo creates a `.git` directory.\n",
    "3. **Working Directory and Staging Area**:\n",
    "   - Your working directory contains the files you're actively working on.\n",
    "   - Use `git add` to move changes from the working directory to the staging area, preparing them for commit.\n",
    "   - `git add .` adds all current changes to the staging area.\n",
    "4. **Commit Changes**:\n",
    "   - Use `git commit` to permanently store changes from the staging area in the repository.\n",
    "   - Always include a meaningful commit message with `git commit -m \"message\"` to describe the changes.\n",
    "5. **Push to GitHub**:\n",
    "   - After committing, use `git push` to upload your changes to GitHub.\n",
    "6. **Pull from GitHub**:\n",
    "   - Use `git pull` to synchronize your local repository with changes from GitHub, especially when switching between different machines or working copies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be descriptive in your commit messages to ease future reference.\n",
    "- Understand the role of the `.git` directory in tracking repository history.\n",
    "- Regularly push your commits to GitHub to back up your progress and make it accessible remotely.\n",
    "- Practice pulling changes frequently when working across different devices to maintain consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lectures, we'll explore more advanced topics, including branching, working with others, handling merge conflicts, and leveraging GitHub for collaborative development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reminder\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Set Aside Learning Time**: Consistent, daily practice is key to mastering Git and GitHub.\n",
    "- **Stay Curious**: Think about how these concepts apply when working in teams and using branches for feature development.\n"

    "# Pushing Code to a Remote Branch on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll learn how to push our locally committed code to a remote branch on GitHub. This is a key step in sharing our work and collaborating with others on projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Remote Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remote Branch:** The version of our branch that exists on GitHub.\n",
    "- **Local vs. Remote:** We've learned to commit changes locally. Now, we'll see how to synchronize these changes with our remote branch on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Push Local Code to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check for Remote Branches:** Use `git remote -v` to view the URL of the remote branch. If you've cloned a repo, this will show the GitHub URL. If there's no remote connection, no URL will be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Repository on GitHub:** After creating a repository locally, the next step is to create it on GitHub. GitHub provides instructions for pushing an existing repository from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connect Local to Remote:** Use `git remote add origin [URL]` to connect your local repository to the remote on GitHub. \"Origin\" is the conventional name used for the primary remote. Replace `[URL]` with the repository URL from GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Push Code to GitHub:** With the remote added, use `git push -u origin main` (or `master`, depending on your git version) to push your commits to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Personal Access Token:** You may need a personal access token from GitHub for authentication.\n",
    "- **Renaming Branches:** GitHub has transitioned from using \"master\" to \"main\" due to the sensitive connotations of the word \"master\". If your local git still uses \"master\", GitHub provides instructions to rename it to \"main\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commands Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git remote -v`: View connected remote branches.\n",
    "- `git remote add origin [URL]`: Connect local repo to remote. Replace `[URL]` with your GitHub repo's URL.\n",
    "- `git push -u origin main`: Push local commits to the remote branch named \"main\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Renaming and Removing Remote Branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To rename: `git remote rename origin [new-name]`\n",
    "- To remove: `git remote remove origin`\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture covers the basics of connecting a local repository to a remote one on GitHub and pushing changes. In the following lectures, we will explore fetching and pulling changes from the remote repository to keep our local version updated.\n"
