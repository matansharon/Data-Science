this is a presonal manual for me to use when i need to remember how to do something in the terminal or in git
when im forgetting to pull from the remote repo. and i get an error message saying that i need to pull first.
i can use this manual to remember how to do it.

1. first i need to check if i have any changes that i need to commit.
2. then i need to commit the changes.
3. git fetch origin
3.1 if origin is not defined i need to add it with the command: git remote add origin <url>
4. git merge origin/main
5. git add conflicted_file
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
6. git push origin main
